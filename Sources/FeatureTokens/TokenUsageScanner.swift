/// machine they are large: measured on the developer's Mac, the Claude Code
/// transcripts touched in a single day came to 52 MB. Re-reading all of that
/// from byte zero on every poll — parsing every line to recompute a number that
/// had grown by a few kilobytes — was, by a wide margin, the most expensive
/// thing the whole app did.

/// A poll in the steady state reads whatever was appended since the last one,
/// which is usually nothing at all.

/// The remembered positions live only as long as the process. They are
/// deliberately NOT persisted: the set of already-counted message ids goes with
/// them, and resuming from a saved offset without that set would silently
/// under-count every message that streamed across a restart. One full pass per
/// launch is the honest price, and `TokenTotalsCache` means the panel still
/// shows a number immediately while it runs.
